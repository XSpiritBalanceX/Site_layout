In projects I used html, Bootstrap 5. All styles are written using the SCSS preprocessor.
Webpack is also connected and configured in the project in order to compile SCSS files into one CSS file.

### Application installation and available scripts ###
To install the application, copy it to your computer. Then run the command:

    npm i
Which installs all the necessary dependencies for the application to work.

    npm run build
Compiles **.js** and **.css** files into the **/dist** build folder. The command links the files correctly in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

    npm run dev
With this call, the Webpack project is assembled and when any files are subsequently changed, the pages are reloaded automatically, there is no need to manually refresh the browser page. Open http://localhost:8080/ in a browser to view the application.
